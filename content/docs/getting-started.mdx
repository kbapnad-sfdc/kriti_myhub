# Getting Started

This is a sample doc. You can replace it with your own content (Agentforce, Cursor, MCP, etc.), similar to Dylan's Salesforce docs.

## Steps

1. Edit or add `.mdx` files in `content/docs/`
2. Update `content/docs/meta.json` to include new pages in the sidebar
3. Use standard Markdown and MDX (you can import React components if needed)

## Example sections

- **Environment setup** – Tools and dependencies
- **Configuration** – How to configure things
- **Guides** – Step-by-step walkthroughs

Replace this placeholder with your actual documentation.

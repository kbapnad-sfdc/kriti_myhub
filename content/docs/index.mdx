# Introduction

Welcome to the docs. This is structured like [Dylan's docs](https://github.com/dylandersen/dylan-andersen-docs): content lives in `content/docs/` as MDX files, and the sidebar is driven by `meta.json`.

## What's here

- **Getting Started** – Setup and first steps
- Add more pages by creating `.mdx` files in `content/docs/` and adding them to `meta.json`

## Adding content

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in `content/docs/` (e.g. `my-topic.mdx`)
2. Add frontmatter with `title` and optional `description`
3. Add the page to `content/docs/meta.json` in the `pages` array:
   ```json
   { "title": "My Topic", "slug": "my-topic" }
   ```

The slug should match the filename without `.mdx`.

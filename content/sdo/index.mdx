# SDO Components

Welcome to the SDO (Salesforce Developer / Solution) components section. This area is structured like Docs: content in `content/sdo/`, sidebar from `meta.json`.

## What's here

- **Features** – Cheatsheet-style table of features with links (Feature | Why it's great | What you need | URL)
- Add more pages by creating `.mdx` files in `content/sdo/` and adding them to `meta.json`

## Adding content

1. Create `.mdx` files in `content/sdo/`
2. Update `content/sdo/meta.json` with new pages
3. For feature tables with URLs, edit `data/sdo-features.json` and view the **Features** page
